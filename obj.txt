CCDC Homework #4

Hello Everyone,

I hope all of you had a great three day weekend. But now its time to get back to work. Last saturday we covered Bash Scripting. Therefore to re-enforce some of the things we learned, I would like you all to create a Bash Script that resets all users passwords on a system.

Steps your script should take
1. Query all users on the system.
2. Create txt file with a list of users on the system.
3. Read from the list and set a password for each user.
4. Extra Credit: Each password is randomized and written to a txt file.

Deliverables
0. Create a Github account. If you haven't done so already, sign up for the Student Developer Pack.
1. Upload your script to Github, email me a link to your repo/script.

Also, if you would like to be considered for the team, please make sure to submit Homeworks 1-3 as soon as possible. Email me so we can work something out.
